# IPlayUListen

## Description
This is a desktop app that allows users to listen to music with each other. It comes with a chat room where users can interact with one another and a song library with music to choose from. There is a "host" for each server that controls what song is played and has the ability to play/pause/skip the song, hence the name IPlayUListen (one of my favorite ODESZA songs).
